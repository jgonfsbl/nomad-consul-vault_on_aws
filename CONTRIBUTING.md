# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because all of us need volunteers to help at some point.

## Testing

Test the configs and ensure everything works for you. If not, clone the repo and starting making your changes. 

## Submitting changes

Please send a PR with a clear list of what you've done. Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,  
Jonathan Gonzalez
